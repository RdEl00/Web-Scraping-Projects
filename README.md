In Data World, we can do a lot of exciting work with the right dataset. Once we have interesting data, we can use Pandas or Matplotlib to analyze or visualize trends. But how do we get that data in the first place?

If it’s provided to us in a well-organized csv or json file, *we’re lucky!* Most of the time, we need to go out and search for it ourselves.

Often times you’ll find the perfect website that has all the data you need, but there’s no way to download it. This is where python web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup comes in handy to scrape the HTML.
